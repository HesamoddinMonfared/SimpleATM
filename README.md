# Simple ATM Emulator

[TOCM]

[TOC]

## List of services
- Bank-service : Access right to database
- Atm-service: Access forbidden to database and make request through bank-service
- Service-registry: register all services via eureka 
- Cloud-gateway: an interface between all services and user request
- Config-server: save all common settings in this service in order to change settings in only one place.

## Port numbers for services
- bank-service: 9001
- atm-service: 9002
- cloud-gateway: 9191
- config-server: 9010
- service-registry: 8761

## Database
- PostgreSQL
- Create a database name it as 'bankdb'.

## Java version
- 12


## Notes
- I have added some comments for documentation as an example (In the bank-service, all AccountEntity*.java files, as well as PrintOutput.java and PasswordType.java files).
- Swagger for bank-service and atm-service is added. (It is better to limit access from bank-Api, but here I allowed user to do actions via bank-Api).
- JWT token authorization is implemented.
- Test in some parts of bank-service is implemented.
- As in requirement, there were no need to implement some Apiâ€™s as well as adding new user, account or card info, but in order to make more convenient, I have added some of them to easy work with swagger.
- Services can run in docker 
- It is better to use common classes in one library and then share between services, but due to the small size of this project, I  have not do that.
- Only Get and Post requests have been used.
- Exception managing is done only in bank-service as example.
